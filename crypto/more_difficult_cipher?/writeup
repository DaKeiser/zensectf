For this challenge I used dcode.fr. There could be other methods as well- but I used this.

Now let us look at the text we have. Ignore all the stuff before the portion that clearly corresponds to the flag - dirwaGEH{k31o0q3_x0_xl3_g2cl70_51h3}
Well, we know that ciphertext dirwaGEH should correspond to plaintext zenseCTF.

Notice that the first e and the second e in the plaintext correspond to different letters in the ciphertext. So this is not a Caesar cipher, or monoalphabetic cipher in general. It is a polyalphabetic one(the easiest way to notice is to see whether the same letter always is encrypted to the same ciphertext).

So at this point the only polyalphabetic cipher you know is Vigenere cipher. 

Now in dcode.fr, automatic decryption does the trick.
But a useful idea for the future, is to fill up that "known plaintext" field. We know that the flag starts with 'zenseCTF{' - so that is the known plaintext we can enter in that field. That too, gives theright answer.
You get the key as "WELCOMEEEEEE" and the plaintext as a quote from The Dark Knight.

Trivia - Adding extra letters to the key messed up Boxentriq's cipher identification - it wrongly decrypted as a double Playfair cipher. So be careful with that tool.
