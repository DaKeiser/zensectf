Magician's Signature Format

During Infin8, our SAC had invited a Magician for a performance on campus and you really loved it. After the show you went and asked him for his Signature. He sent you an email of his signature, as he thought it was tech-savvy. On opening the mail you find the corupted image which is given below.
After cursing him a million times, being the hacker you are, you decide to fix the corrupted bytes in the image to recover the signature.
