# ZenseCTF

We shall be holding a Jeopardy type of CTF which runs for 24 hrs starting on June 20th at 5 PM. Students can form a team of max size 4/team. 


**Phases:**
- Material for preparation
- Setting up Infrastructure and testing it
- Setting of challenges

**Admins:**
- Hemanth Chitti(Crypto)
- Kartik Sama(Bin-Exp & Reversing)
- Pranav Vardia(Forensics & Web)
- Ruturaj Mohite(Web & Misc)
- Sai Rithwik M(Forensics, Crypto and Misc)

**Phase 1: Material for preparation**

We will be giving away [PicoCTF material](https://picoctf.com/resources) for preparation for this CTF. It is highly recommended to read this to get a clear idea on what to solve before solving the challs.
You are free to read the guides in any order. But this is the order we suggest:
- [General Skills](https://picoctf.com/learning_guides/Book-1-General-Skills.pdf)
- [Forensics](https://picoctf.com/learning_guides/Book-4-Forensics.pdf)
- [Reversing](https://picoctf.com/learning_guides/Book-6-Reversing.pdf)
- [Crypto](https://picoctf.com/learning_guides/Book-2-Cryptography.pdf)
- [Web](https://picoctf.com/learning_guides/Book-3-Web-Exploitation.pdf)
- [Binary Exploitation](https://picoctf.com/learning_guides/Book-5-Binary-Exploitation.pdf)

For educational outcomes on learning this, please refer to [this](https://picoctf.com/Pico-CTF-2018-Educational-Outcomes.pdf)

Preparation from this hardly takes a week given you spend 1/2 hour atleast per day. You might also want to solve some challenges from PicoCTF too to understand how challenges work.

**Phase 2: Infrastructure Deployment and Testing**

To host a CTF we need the following infra:
- A framework on which our CTF runs. Our choice - [CTFd](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd). Alternatives are [PicoCTF](https://github.com/picoCTF/picoCTF) and [FBCTF](https://github.com/facebookarchive/fbctf)
- Cloud Infra/Servers and stuff- Google Cloud/ Digital Ocean/ AWS
We are not completely sure about this and might need some guidance regarding this.
- DoS protection - Do we need it? If yes then cloudflare.
- Domain name and stuff from Name cheap - Github Student Pack Credits/ some other way.

This is a [guide](https://medium.com/bug-bounty-hunting/zero-dollar-ctf-infrastructure-how-581c262c3509) which we are referring to.

Testing the infra will begin 5 days before the event begins. Probably on 15th.

**Phase 3: Challenge Preparation**

We shall be having challenges from the following categories. Beside the category we have an approximate count on number of challenges

- Binary Exploitation(3)
- Cryptography(7)
- Forensics(5)
- Reverse Engineering(5)
- Misc(7)
- Web(5)

Total approximate of challenges - 30 to 40

Tentative date by which challenges must be ready so that they can be tested, especially _Web_ is June 15.

We shall try to make the challenges as beginner friendly as possible. But we might increase the difficulty of challenges in some categories. Overall this would be a CTF which even a beginner could try working on. But we highly recommend you to look through the guides to prepare for this CTF.
