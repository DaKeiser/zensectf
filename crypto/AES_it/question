So Hemanth knew about Rithwik and hence had a question on a safer side for emergency purposes. He believes this would teach the concepts of AES way better than the previous question.

Connect to `nc chal.zense.co.in 6967` to access the challenge

Message from the author: It is requested that you test the exploit locally first and then try to implement the exploit by connecting.

Steps to reproduce the challenge:
- Download the file `server.py`
- Make a file named `secret.py` and add this in your file
```python3
FLAG = <some random flag>
KEY = <some random key>
```
- Now fire up the server using `python3 server.py`
- Now open another terminal and join as client using `nc localhost 6967`
