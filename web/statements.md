1. **PRO MAFS**

dir: source_flag

statement: Mr. Succ claims to be the next 'human computer' for he can calculate huge multiplications in immesurable time. He built this website and says he'll give you the flag if you beat his time in multiplying numbers. Time to get to the source of this problem.

HINT: Maybe look at the source code?

2. **MR ROBOTS.TXT**

dir: robots

statement: Hello, friend. There's a powerful group of people out there that are secretly running the world. I'm talking about the guys no one knows about, the ones that are invisible. The top 1% of the top 1%, the guys that play God without permission. Don't let them crawl your secrets.

3. **FREE FLAGS**

dir: path_trav

statement: Prof. Chetan Parikh assigned you with a job to buy new iiitb flags(the ones they hang on lightpoles every fest). You find this shady looking website on the internet claiming to offer free flags. So of course, you click on it because the money saved on flags is the money that goes directly in supporting your feasts at Hyderabadi Spice.

HINT: What is local file inclusion?

4. **SCAM FLAGS**

dir: apache_log_poisoning

statement: Just like every shady looking website on the interet, the flags site turned out to be a massive scam. They never delivered the flags. The fest is just a few days away and you NEED those flags. Intel has it that the site owner himself has some really good flags that he keeps in his /home, why not steal his?

HINT: What can you do with an apache log file?

HINT2: '<?php.....'? that's a wierd name for a browser

5. **GOODBYE, FRIEND.**

dir: ssrf

statement: Did Whiterose's machine work? What is this alternate reality that I'm in? Am I the real Elliot Alderson? The Dark Army...gone? Seek answers.

HINT: How does The Whiterose Foundation authenticate the superusers? Seems pretty unsecure to me.

HINT2: Whiterose often checks the posts reported as suspicious herself. She has what you seek.
